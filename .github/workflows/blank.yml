  with:
    # Artifact name
    name: # optional, default is artifact
    # A file, directory or wildcard pattern that describes what to upload
    path: 
    # The desired behavior if no files are found using the provided path.
Available Options:
  warn: Output a warning but do not fail the action
  error: Fail the action with an error message
  ignore: Do not output any warnings or errors, the action does not fail

    if-no-files-found: # optional, default is warn
    # Duration after which artifact will expire in days. 0 means using default retention.
Minimum 1 day. Maximum 90 days unless changed from the repository settings page.

    retention-days: # optional
    # The level of compression for Zlib to be applied to the artifact archive. The value can range from 0 to 9: - 0: No compression - 1: Best speed - 6: Default compression (same as GNU Gzip) - 9: Best compression Higher levels will result in better compression, but will take longer to complete. For large files that are not easily compressed, a value of 0 is recommended for significantly faster uploads.

    compression-level: # optional, default is 6
    # If true, an artifact with a matching name will be deleted before a new one is uploaded. If false, the action will fail if an artifact for the given name already exists. Does not fail if the artifact does not exist.

    overwrite: # optional, default is false
    # If true, hidden files will be included in the artifact. If false, hidden files will be excluded from the artifact.

    include-hidden-files: # optional, default is false
          
    # A list of files, directories, and wildcard patterns to cache and restore
    path: 
    # An explicit key for restoring and saving the cache
    key: 
    # An ordered multiline string listing the prefix-matched keys, that are used for restoring stale cache if no cache hit occurred for key. Note `cache-hit` returns false in this case.
    restore-keys: # optional
    # The chunk size used to split up large files during upload, in bytes
    upload-chunk-size: # optional
    # An optional boolean when enabled, allows windows runners to save or restore caches that can be restored or saved respectively on other platforms
    enableCrossOsArchive: # optional, default is false
    # Fail the workflow if cache entry is not found
    fail-on-cache-miss: # optional, default is false
    # Check if a cache entry exists for the given input(s) (key, restore-keys) without downloading the cache
    lookup-only: # optional, default is false
    # Run the post step to save the cache even if another step before fails
    save-always: # optional, default is false

    go-version-file: # optional
    # Set this option to true if you want the action to always check for the latest available version that satisfies the version spec
    check-latest: # optional
    # Used to pull Go distributions from go-versions. Since there's a default, this is typically not supplied by the user. When running this action on github.com, the default value is sufficient. When running on GHES, you can pass a personal access token for github.com if you are experiencing rate limiting.
    token: # optional, default is ${{ github.server_url == 'https://github.com' && github.token || '' }}
    # Used to specify whether caching is needed. Set to true, if you'd like to enable caching.
    cache: # optional, default is true
    # Used to specify the path to a dependency file - go.sum
    cache-dependency-path: # optional
    # Target architecture for Go to use. Examples: x86, x64. Will use system architecture by default.
